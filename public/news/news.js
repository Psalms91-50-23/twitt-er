            body:"Singing career over for Taylor Swift?  Certainly not, but at 32, the American star,recently graduated started a new chapter in his life by directing the short film All Too Well, which is the name of one of his tracks released, in short version, in 2012. The artist was at the Festival of the Tribeca film, on Saturday, June 11, 2022 at the Beacon Theater in New York, to defend his film. Why did you start directing? Ive been working on film sets for my music videos since the age of 15 and Ive always been curious to learn the process of directing.  I ask questions to directors, technicians, cameramen since my beginnings to absorb as much knowledge as possible.  First, I wanted to learn editing.  I would sit in the editing room and give advice on how to make changes in my clips. How did you start this directing process? It didn't happen overnight.  10 years ago I started writing scripts for my videos.  It was I who contacted the directors to tell them about my ideas.  The visual of my songs has always been paramount in my mind, as it is a natural extension of the lyrics I perform.  I finally had the courage to direct my first music video for The Man (note: published in February 2020) since I wanted a female director and I couldn't find one.What does this role of director bring you? It feels like a natural transition to me, because I always see the story and the images in my head when I write my lyrics.  Its an extension of my creativity.  But the transition didn't happen overnight (laughs).  I was afraid of being seen as an impostor, because a lot of people go to film school, not me. Why did you choose your song All Too Well for your first short film with this version of almost 15 minutes? I love writing about a girls transition from childhood to adulthood.  Around the age of 19-20, a girl is asked to behave like an adult when she is just emerging from adolescence.  It was a test for me.  A young woman is still fragile at that time, we are still looking for ourselves.  I think you have to be around 30 to have a clear idea of yourself. Are you going to give up the song for the realization? I dont want to have to choose.  I hope to make a feature film soon, but I want to find an intimate project, not a blockbuster.",

Witherspoon, who produced the film, revealed she freaked out when she found out the Grammy winner tailor made Carolina especially for the movie  without telling anyone. She read this book and loved it so much, and then she heard we were making a movie [while] she was making her folklore album and then she wrote a song with that whole folklore team, which was so haunting, and magical and beautiful, Witherspoon continued to gush. I was blown away. Added Newman, She had gone and written this song out of just pure inspiration and sort of said, I dont know if youll like it, but here it is!' The director added Taylor wrote this gorgeous letter to us explaining how they chose instruments that were only available before 1953 and she recorded it in one take the way they recorded songs at the time. Newman also admitted, The first time I listened to it, I just started bawling and I said, I dont know whats happening to me right now. I mean, I love singing along to Taylor Swift songs but I never cry like this. Newman, who is also a fan of the book and its earthshaking ending, said Taylor perfectly captured the very specific feeling readers experience upon finishing the last chapter. We wanted to leave audiences with that same sort of emotional feeling and her song just leans right into that, she said. Where the Crawdads Sing arrives in theaters July 15.

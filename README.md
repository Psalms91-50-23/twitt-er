### My Unique Twist on Twitter

This project leverages a variety of technologies, including the Context API for state management, Next.js, JavaScript, CSS, React, and Sanity as the CMS for the backend. It showcases my ability to integrate different tools and frameworks to build a dynamic, full-featured application.

## Key Features in the project
    -   User Authentication: Create and log into user accounts.
    -   Portfolio Exploration: Visit other user portfolios by clicking on their profile images.
    -   CRUD Functionality: Create, read, and delete posts. Portfolio information can be updated, but post updates are not implemented (mirroring Twitter's restriction on editing tweets).
    -   Media Integration: Upload images/images from URL  and display videos from URL
    -   News Feed: Stay updated with news from external links.
    -   Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly and adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.
